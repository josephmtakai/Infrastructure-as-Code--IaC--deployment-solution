# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Deployment

## Overview

This project automates the deployment and management of infrastructure resources using Ansible and Python. It includes Ansible playbooks for setting up and configuring various components of the infrastructure and a Python script to orchestrate the deployment process.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Requirements

Ensure you have Python and Ansible installed. Then, install the required Python packages:


pip install -r python/requirements.txt

Run the Deployment Script
To deploy the infrastructure, execute the following command:


Copy code
python python/deploy_infrastructure.py

Customize the Infrastructure
You can customize the infrastructure by editing the Ansible playbooks located in the ansible/playbooks/ directory.

Ansible Playbooks:

site.yml: The main playbook that includes roles for web server, database, and load balancer.

webserver.yml: Configures a web server using Nginx.

database.yml: Configures a MySQL database server.

loadbalancer.yml: Configures a load balancer using HAProxy.

Inventory File
The inventory file (ansible/inventories/hosts) lists the IP addresses of the servers that the playbooks will target.

Next Steps:
- You can extend the project by adding more roles, tasks, or even integrating with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- Implement error handling and logging in the Python script for better debugging and monitoring.

This setup will give you a comprehensive solution for managing infrastructure as code using Ansible and Python.
